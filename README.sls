Tooele
======

Tooele is a collection of Python files for handling OBD2 connectivity over both
Bluetooth and USB.

At the time of this writing, there are a number of libraries available for
handling serial-based OBD2 connections. Unfortunately, none of these seem to be
under active development at the moment. Worse, they do all seem to be usable for
USB-based connections, none of them are suitable for use with any of the
numerous Bluetooth OBD2 readers now available for sale on the Internet.

This library aims to fill in the gaps, and provide this functionality using
existing Python libraries for both serial and Bluetooth connections.
Additionally, it is released under the Apache 2 license, in order to encourage
development by commercial entities, as well as by hobbyists.
